# Welcome to my Playground!
Hello! This repository is where I write and run some code to reinforce my understandings on certain matters. The code will, by no means, be optimised, as I am only writing them to help myself better understand things.

Code will mostly be written in Python since it allows me to quickly write mock ups allowing me to test things.
